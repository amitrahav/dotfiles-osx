# Amit Rahav's Dotfiles

This is a repo for all my dotfiles. mostly cloned from [Nick Plekhanov's Dotfiles](https://github.com/nicksp/dotfiles). It's for my mac book - mid 2015.

Few stuff I changed:

1. adding [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) loading oh-my-zsh
2. removing atom stuff
3. fixing some issues with ls coloring.
